My name is Gonçalo and I am an undergraduate student pursuing a CS&E Bachelor @ IST.

My main interests are Fullstack Web Development, DevOps and Computer Networks. I use mostly Golang and Python. Currently I am interested in learning Elixir.

In this blog I will write about personal projects and miscellaneous stuff! ✒️
